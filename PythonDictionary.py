# PYTHON GUI TO GET THE MEANING OF USER-ENTERED WORDS USING THE PyDictionary Module

# PyDictionary is a Dictionary Module for Python 2/3 to get meanings, translations,
# synonyms and Antonyms of words. It uses WordNet for getting meanings, Google for
# translations, and synonym.com for getting synonyms and antonyms. This module uses
# Python Requests, BeautifulSoup4 and goslate as dependencies
#
# The module can be installed using the command - pip install PyDictionary

# Importing necessary packages
import tkinter as tk
import tkinter.scrolledtext as sb_text
from tkinter import *
from PyDictionary import PyDictionary

# Defining CreateWidgets() function to create necessary tkinter widgets

    wordEntry.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=10, pady=5)

    searchButton = Button(root, text="SEARCH", command=findMeaning)

    root.meaningDetails.grid(row=2, column=0, rowspan=10, columnspan=3, padx=10, pady=5)
    # Making the Text Widget uneditable by setting state parameter of config() to DISABLED

    root.meaningDetails.insert("end", meaningDetails)
    # Making Widget uneditable again after the displaying list of news from feed
    root.meaningDetails.config(state=DISABLED)

# Creating object of tk class
root = tk.Tk()

# Setting the title, background color, windowsize
# & disabling the resizing property

root.config(background="skyblue4")

# Calling the CreateWidgets() function
